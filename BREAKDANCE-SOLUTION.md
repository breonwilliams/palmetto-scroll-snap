# ✅ Breakdance Solution - Palmetto Scroll Snap

## The Problem We Discovered
Your diagnostic revealed that Breakdance works differently than expected:
- Uses "Breakdance Zero Theme" 
- Template filter runs at priority 1000000 (very late)
- Standard Breakdance functions aren't available
- Headers/footers are handled internally by Breakdance

## The Solution: Content Injection Method

Instead of trying to override Breakdance's template system, we now **inject the scroll snap content directly into your page content**. This works WITH Breakdance instead of fighting against it.

## Three Ways to Use the Plugin

### Method 1: Automatic Content Injection (Recommended)
1. Go to **Settings > Scroll Snap Pages**
2. Enable the plugin
3. Select your pages
4. The scroll snap content will automatically replace the page content
5. Your Breakdance header and footer remain intact

### Method 2: Shortcode
Add this shortcode to any page in Breakdance:
```
[palmetto_scroll_snap]
```

### Method 3: PHP Template Tag
Add this to your theme or template:
```php
<?php echo do_shortcode('[palmetto_scroll_snap]'); ?>
```

## What's New in This Version

### 1. **Better Breakdance Detection**
- Detects "Breakdance Zero Theme"
- Checks for Breakdance in plugins
- Looks for Breakdance classes

### 2. **Content Injection System**
- Works WITH Breakdance's template system
- Preserves your header and footer
- No template conflicts

### 3. **Self-Contained Scroll System**
- All styles are scoped to avoid conflicts
- JavaScript runs independently
- Disables smooth scroll only for our sections

## Installation Steps

1. **Upload the Plugin**
   - Upload entire `palmetto-scroll-snap` folder
   - Activate the plugin

2. **Configure Settings**
   - Go to Settings > Scroll Snap Pages
   - Enable plugin
   - Select pages to apply scroll snap

3. **Test It**
   - Visit your selected page
   - The content should be replaced with scroll snap sections
   - Header and footer should remain from Breakdance

## Features

### 6 Scroll Snap Sections:
1. **Why Choose** - Company benefits
2. **Services** - Wildlife services grid  
3. **Wildlife Control** - Professional info
4. **Process** - 4-step process
5. **FAQs** - Common questions
6. **Call to Action** - Contact info

### Navigation:
- Progress dots on the right
- Keyboard navigation (arrow keys)
- Smooth scrolling between sections
- Mobile responsive (disables on small screens)

## Troubleshooting

### If the scroll snap doesn't appear:
1. Check that the page is selected in settings
2. Clear Breakdance cache
3. Check browser console for errors
4. Try adding the shortcode manually

### If header/footer are missing:
- This shouldn't happen with the new method
- Make sure you're using the latest version
- Check that Breakdance template is set correctly

### If smooth scroll conflicts persist:
- The plugin now isolates its scroll behavior
- Only affects elements inside `.pss-scroll-container`
- Breakdance smooth scroll remains for other elements

## Console Errors Fixed

✅ **Lenis Constructor Error** - No longer tries to create Lenis
✅ **Header Builder Error** - Removed dependency on Breakdance elements
✅ **Smooth Scroll Conflicts** - Isolated to our container only

## How It Works

1. **Page Load**: Plugin detects if current page is selected
2. **Content Filter**: Hooks into WordPress content filter
3. **Content Replacement**: Replaces page content with scroll snap sections
4. **Preservation**: Breakdance header/footer remain untouched
5. **Initialization**: JavaScript initializes scroll snap behavior

## Advantages of This Approach

- ✅ Works with ANY Breakdance setup
- ✅ No template conflicts
- ✅ Preserves Breakdance functionality
- ✅ Easy to enable/disable per page
- ✅ Can be used via shortcode for flexibility
- ✅ No more console errors

## Need Custom Content?

The scroll sections are in:
`templates/palmetto-scroll-content.php`

You can modify:
- Section content
- Colors and styles
- Number of sections
- Animation effects

## Support

If you still have issues:
1. Run the diagnostic tool (Tools > Scroll Snap Diagnostics)
2. Check that Breakdance is detected correctly
3. Verify page is selected in settings
4. Clear all caches
